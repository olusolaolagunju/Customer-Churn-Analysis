To do this, a regression analysis was performed to determine the key performing indicators that could influence the customer churning rate. Customers were segmented into ten cohorts per KPI to provide a clear understanding of the churning situation.

The KPIs obtained demonstrated that customers on One and Two years contract plans are high-value customers and they contribute the highest to the ROI. The churning of high-value customers must be prevented by all means possible, including offering suitable calls and data packages not included in their contract plans.

Consequently, customers at high churn risk are customers that have spent less than 17 months in this quarter review, spent less than the average total charges, and total long-distance charges, especially, those on monthly subscription contracts. 

It is paramount to come up with A/B Testing including data, calls discounts, and offers, to  mitigate churning and drive ROI 

Here is a step-by-step procedure on how I performed the regression and cohort analysis and other metrics. [VIEW SOLUTION]()
